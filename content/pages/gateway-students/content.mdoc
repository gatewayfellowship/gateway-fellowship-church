Gateway Students exists to reach the next generation with the gospel. We want to see lives changed in the students that reverberates into our community, into our schools, and to the nations. We seek to come alongside parents and help raise up disciples who love Jesus and love people. We would love for you to join us on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights as our middle and high schoolers meet to dive into God's Word, play games, and build relationships with one another.
