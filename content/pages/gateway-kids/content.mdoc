At Gateway Kids, we are passionate about training up the next generation to lead, love, and serve Jesus! We strive to come alongside parents to help them disciple their children at home while we point them to Jesus when they are here.

Through the reading of Godâ€™s Word, worship, games, and crafts, your child will hear the gospel every Sunday and Wednesday. It is our desire for them to start to understand the good news of Jesus from a young age!

We take the safety of our kids seriously! All of our members serving in Gateway Kids have gone through a background check and Ministry Safe Training. We would love for you to arrive early to get them checked in, check out their classroom, and meet their teachers!
