John 17:17 says "Sanctify them in truth, your word is truth."

We believe that the main way to grow in the knowledge of the whole council of God and become more Christ-like is through the reading, hearing, and studying of God's Word. We provide classes for all ages to grow in their walk with Christ in community together.
