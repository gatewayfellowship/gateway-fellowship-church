Our Women's Ministry is passionate about Biblical Womanhood. We strive to teach women how to read their Bible in a way that stirs their affections for Christ and overflows into all areas of their life - home, church, work, relationships, etc.

We offer 3 different women's studies that meet throughout the week. Contact the front office for more information on times and locations.

Older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good, and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled. Titus 2:3-5
